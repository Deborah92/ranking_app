  Scenario: Updating a result like an admin
    When I am signed in as "admin@example.com"
    And I follow "Results management"
    And I follow "Edit" within "#result_1"
    And I select "Validated" from "Status"
    And I press "Update Result"
    Then I should see "Result has been updated. A message with the result's link has been sent to user email address"
